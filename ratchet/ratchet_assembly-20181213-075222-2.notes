This time I set the top layers to shrink by 0.05mm, hopefully creating
0.1mm additional separation between adjacent surfaces and allowing for
the parts to move freely.

There was some sticking. The hub released fairly easily. One of the
arms chipped when I broke it free. Some of the other arms broke, so
the clearance is definitely not enough. Also, the spring arms still
seem to be too strong - I'll try reducing their width.
